    "Reusability: Once a function is defined, it can be reused multiple times throughout the program or in different programs. This reduces redundancy and saves time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Maintainability: By organizing code into functions, it becomes easier to update and maintain. If a change is required, it can be made in one place, and all parts of the program that use the function will reflect the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Readability: Functions help in structuring the code in a way that is easier to read and follow. Each function has a clear purpose, making the overall code more understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Abstraction: Functions allow programmers to abstract away details and focus on higher-level logic. The internal workings of a function can be hidden, enabling users to use the function without needing to understand its internal implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Testing and Debugging: Functions can be tested independently of the rest of the program, making it easier to identify and fix bugs. This modular approach to testing can significantly improve the reliability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Parameterization: Functions can accept parameters, allowing them to operate on different data inputs. This flexibility makes functions more powerful and versatile.\n",

    "    \n",

    "Multiple Exceptions: You can have multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions or a single except block to handle any type of exception.\n",
